# Stacklands LessLag Mod

Reduces lag. Atm it seems to improve FPS by around 25%-33% with default settings.

Specifically:
- Avoids re-checking whether something can be crafted if a stack hasn't changed
- Makes card-push-physics more efficient (at the cost of some jank)
- Avoids updating unchanging equipment descriptions every frame
- (Disabled by default) Updates booster shop less often
